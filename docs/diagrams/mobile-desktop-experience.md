## Cross-Platform File Selection

This diagram shows how the app provides optimized experiences for different devices:

## Mobile Experience
- **Native Integration**: Uses device's built-in file picker
- **Camera Access**: Direct camera capture for taking new photos
- **Photo Library**: Access to existing photos in the device gallery
- **File Browser**: Access to files stored on the device or cloud storage

## Desktop Experience
- **File Dialog**: Standard browser file selection dialog
- **Local Files**: Browse and select files from the computer's file system
- **Drag & Drop**: (Future enhancement) Could support drag-and-drop functionality

## Unified Processing
Once a file is selected, both platforms use the same processing pipeline, ensuring consistent behavior and quality across all devices.
